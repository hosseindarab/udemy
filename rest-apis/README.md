## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a RESTful API using Laravel 10, a powerful PHP framework. It provides a starting point for building APIs, with features like user authentication and CRUD operations on resources.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - PHP (>= 7.4)
   - Composer
   - Laravel 10
   - Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

2. **Installation**:
   - Clone this repository.
   - Install dependencies with `composer install`.
   - Set up your environment variables (e.g., database configuration, JWT secret).
   - Run migrations and seeders with `php artisan migrate --seed`.
   
3. **Usage**:
   - Start the Laravel development server: `php artisan serve`.
   - You can now access the API at `http://localhost:8000/api`.

## Features

- User Authentication with JWT.
- CRUD operations on resources.
- API Resource Transformers for data shaping.
- Validation and error handling.
- Secure and well-structured code.

## API Endpoints

- **Users**:
   - `GET /api/users` - List all users.
   - `POST /api/users` - Create a new user.
   - `GET /api/users/{id}` - Retrieve user by ID.
   - `PUT /api/users/{id}` - Update user by ID.
   - `DELETE /api/users/{id}` - Delete user by ID.

- **Other Resources**:
   - Define your API endpoints for other resources here.

## Authentication

- User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 
- To access protected endpoints, include the Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

## Testing

- Use PHPUnit for testing.
- Run tests with `php artisan test`.
